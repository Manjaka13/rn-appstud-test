# Libraries used

### React Native / Expo / React

**Why**: We use React Native to develop cross-platform application with Javascript. It's the core component. We use Expo because it is now the recommended way to kickstart a React Native application ( as create-react-native-app wash deprecated in favor of expo ).
**Where**: It's the core component, so basically everywhere.

### React-Navigation

**Why**: Recommended way to handle application navigation. It was actually coming with the recommended `expo` starter.
**Where**: Mostly in `./navigation` folder

### Prettier

**Why**: To format code and avoid messy code.
**Where**: In all files that needs formating.
